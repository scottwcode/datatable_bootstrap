# datatable_bootstrap4

A grid-like data table using some of bootstrap features. The first row is the header with the rest being data that is added manually in the code. There is a search feature, pagination and click-sorting (asc/desc) for each column header.

You can view/run it by opening index.html in a browser or running Live Server via VSCode.
